Library Management System
This is a simple terminal-based library management system developed using Java. It allows users to manage a collection of books with basic operations like adding, listing, searching, borrowing, and returning books.

📌 Purpose of the Project
The main goal is to build a functional book management system using object-oriented programming principles in Java. This project was developed as part of the Patika+ Java Backend Web Development Program.
